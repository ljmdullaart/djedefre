Djedefre is a tool for documenting your network. 

Djedefre consists of 3 parts:

- the database
- scan scripts
- the GUI

The scan scripts fill the database. The GUI displays the network in the database and
allows the user to change certain values. The database is created when the GUI is
first started.


Some time ago, there was a tool called Cheops, that automated network discovery and gave 
a nice drawing of the network. Cheops is now abandonware. Djedefre was pharaoh after Cheops.
The main difference between Cheops and Djedefre is, that Djedefre assumes that the 
network is managed. This means that there is access to at least some servers, routers 
and switches.
