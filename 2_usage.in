.h1 Using Djedefre

.h2 First start

After installing or unpacking,

- Move to the directory where 
.fixed djedefre
is installed.
- Make sure that there is a directory
.fixed database
and create it if it is not there
- start the GUI with
.fixed ./dedefre.pl &

You will be greeted with a cartouche depicting the hieroglyphs for Djedefre with a number of buttons above it.

The buttons give access to funtionality:

- List network provides several lists (servers, subnets, interfaces)
- Plot network provides a drawing of the network
- Options tell Djedefre to do or change something

At this point, when you press the "Plot network", you will get an emty drawing.

.h2 Start scanning

To get some information into the database, scanscripts are used. These scanscripts can be 
launched from the "Options" page. Although it is possible to launch the scripts in any
sequence you like, some scripts rely on information in the database. For example: the "subnet"
scan scans all the subnets in the database. If there are no subnets, nothing is scanned.

The best start would be to scab the "local system". This launches the script
.fixed scan_local_system.sh
in the
.fixed scan_scripts
directory in a separate
.fixed xterm
window. 

When the scan is finished, the plot page will show the local system and the subnets that it 
is connected to.

With the left mouse button, you can pick-up the server and the subnets and place them anywhere
on the canvas that you like.

As there are now subnets in the database, a scan of the subnets is possible. Select "subnet" 
under Scan scripts in the Options page. Again, an 
.fixed xterm
window opens, and when it is finished, the plot will look something like this:
